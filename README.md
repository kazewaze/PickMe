### A simple random picker... why?
Because when I couldn't make my mind up on something (ALL THE TIME), I would find myself on this sketchy random picker site that made my phone heat up... yikes. The URL was miniwebtool.com or something like that. So yeah... I said enough is enough and built my own that is add free and won't cook your phone over easy every time you use it. Enjoy :) - kazewaze
